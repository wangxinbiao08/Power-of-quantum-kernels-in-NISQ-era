# Power of quantum kernels in NISQ era
As we get an interseting theory result which the number of training set has a negative effect to the generalization error in terms of the entry in quantum kernel matrix, we need to conduct experiments to verify the theory.  Given different hyperparameters, including the size of training dataset, the number of measurements, we verify the experiment results of noiseless model and depolarizd noise model (depolarizing error 0.3) through the testing accuracy and training accuracy. 

More simulation details can be found in our paper ['*Towards understanding the power of quantum kernels in NISQ era*'](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-08-30-531/).
