# Quantum-Kernel-for-Power-of-Data
As we get a interseting theory result which the number of training set has a bad  effect to the generalization error in terms of the entry in quantum kernel matrix, we need to conduct a experiment to verify the theory.  Given different hyperparameter, including the number of train, shots (num_test=100), we verify the experiment result of noiseless model and noise model(depolarizing error, 0.3), especially the testing accuracy and training accuracy.
