# Power of quantum kernels in NISQ era
This repository is used for verifying the theoretical results achieved in our work [(Arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16774.pdf) where we first prove that in NISQ era, the advantage of quantum kernels vanishes for large size of datasets, few number of measurements, and large system noise.
 
More simulation details can be found in our paper ['*Towards understanding the power of quantum kernels in NISQ era*'](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-08-30-531/) which has been published in ***Quantum*** journal.
