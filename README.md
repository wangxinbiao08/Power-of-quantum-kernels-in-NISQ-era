# Power of quantum kernels in NISQ era
As we get an interseting theory result showing that the size of training dataset has a negative impact on the generalization error, we need to conduct experiments to verify the theory.  Given different hyperparameters, including the size of training dataset, the number of measurements, we conduct experiments for noiseless model and depolarizd noise model (depolarizing error 0.3) through the testing accuracy and training accuracy. 

More simulation details can be found in our paper ['*Towards understanding the power of quantum kernels in NISQ era*'](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-08-30-531/).
